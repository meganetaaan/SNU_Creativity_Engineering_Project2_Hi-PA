# Hi-PA
A Responsive, Multi-sensor, Smart, Web-App, Which Connects Audience &amp; Presenter

The page use *Google Cloud Speech API* for speech recognition and *clmtrackr* for mouth tracking. We are going to write a script based on text converted from speech. We use mouth tracking to determine if the person is speaking or not. Method for this determination is flexable; currenly we just use gap between position of upper lip and lower lip.

### Note
You need speaker and webcam to use demo. If you do not have webcam, it automatically use default video.
